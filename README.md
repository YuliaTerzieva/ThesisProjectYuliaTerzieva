The implementation of the model by Alberts et al. (2016) is in file VisualVestibularVeticalityModel.py. 

The data analysis as described in the Method section is in file initial_data_analysis.py. To run the analysis on a given condition ("frame", "tilt15" or "tilt30") and save it afterwards the file organization_initial_data_analysis.py can be used.

All the plots from the report can be generated in plot.py. 

Each folder (NoTilt, Tilt15 and Tilt30) contains 16 figures(one for each participant), a text file with the corresponing lapse rates and a dataset with all the &mu; and &sigma; saved as a pickle.
